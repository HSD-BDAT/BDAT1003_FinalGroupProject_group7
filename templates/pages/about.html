<h4> AQI INDEX </h4>
Air quality index is a scale used to show how polluted the air is. 
The calculation of AQI is based on standards established after medical researches for the acceptable levels of air pollution. 
Two important benefits of air quality indices are, inform the public about the air quality in an understandable manner and to help countries develop policies for better air quality.
The forecasting of air pollution itâ€™s the best tool that each county needs to use for taking measures in the future. Different country has their own air quality indices. Canada is using Air Quality Health Index that provide a number from 1 to 10+ to indicate the level of health risk associates with local air quality. Index 1-3 is considered low risk and ideal for outdoor activities. Index 4-6 is considered moderate risk and no need to modify the usual outdoor activities unless experience symptoms. Index 7-10 is considered high risk and if experience symptoms due air pollution to consider reducing activities outdoors. And the last index is very high for above index 10 and it is important to reduce outdoor activities if experience any symptoms.

<h4>How AQI is measured?</h4>
To measure the AQI index is based in eight pollutants based in ambient concentration considering the standards of health impact. The eight important pollutants name are (PM) 10, PM2.5, Ozone (O3), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), lead (Pb) and ammonia (NH3) to calculate the AQI of a country or area. 
Different index AQI  uses different computational time for example the Nowcast that we took the data consider the most 12 hours of monitoring data and the NowCast weights consider the most recent hours of data more heavily than an ordinary 12-hour average when pollutant levels are changing
